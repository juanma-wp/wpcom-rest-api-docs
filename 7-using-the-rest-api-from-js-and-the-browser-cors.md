The [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/) can be used directly from the browser using Javascript. If you whitelist the domains you want to use for your application, we will send the correct [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) headers. Both authenticated and unauthenticated calls are supported. To make authenticated requests follow the [implicit section of the OAuth documentation](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/) to get a user token.

All examples use plain JavaScript with the Fetch API.

## Unauthenticated Requests

You can make unauthenticated GET requests with no additional work. Just make a simple HTTP request:

```js
fetch("https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/en.blog.wordpress.com/")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // data contains site information
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

## Authenticated Requests

To make authenticated requests, you must provide a token that verifies the resource owner has granted the app permission to act on their behalf.

### Get/Store User Token

To get a valid access token for the current user, your app must use the OAuth workflow, where the user explicitly grants permission. For client-side apps, you can use the [OAuth 2.0 implicit flow](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/), which doesnâ€™t require a client secret.

### Make the request

When making the request you just need to pass the access token as a header.

```js
fetch(`https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/${site_id}/posts/new`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    content: 'testing test'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // Handle the response data
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

### Whitelist Origins

To prevent CORS errors when making authenticated API calls from your browser-based application, you must whitelist the domains that will be making those requests. If you don't whitelist your domain, you'll receive a CORS error like this:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/me/' from origin 'https://www.my-demo-domain.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

You can whitelist your domain(s) while creating or configuring your application with the [application manager](https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/).

To whitelist multiple domains, enter each domain URL on a separate line in the "Javascript Origins" input field.
