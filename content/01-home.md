# REST API

Welcome to the WordPress.com REST API documentation. 

You can find a list of available endpoints in the [REST API Reference](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/reference). To explore and test them interactively, head over to the [Developer Console](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/console/).

If you’re not sure how to make calls to the API check the following links to locate the topic you’re interested in. If you have never worked with the WordPress.com REST API before, consider reading through the following resources in the order listed:

- **[Getting Started](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/getting-started/)**: Check this guide to learn what the WordPress.com REST API is it and how to use it.
- **[Reference](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/reference/)**: Browse a comprehensive catalog of available REST API endpoints organized by functionality. Each endpoint includes links to detailed documentation with input parameters, output formats, and example requests in both curl and PHP. Categories include Users, Sites, Posts, Comments, Taxonomy, Media, Stats, and more.
- **[Namespaces](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/namespaces/)**: A guide to the three WordPress.com REST API namespaces — `/rest/`, `/wp/`, and `/wpcom/` — as shown in the  [Developer Console](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/console/), to help developers pick the right endpoints for their compatibility and feature needs.
- **[OAuth2 Authentication](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/)**: Learn more about how WordPress.com and Jetpack leverage OAuth2 to enable secure application access to their APIs without storing sensitive credentials, while giving users control over their connections.
- **[WordPress.com connect](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/wpcc/)**: Implement the "Login with WordPress.com" functionality for user authentication. This specialized OAuth2 implementation allows millions of WordPress.com users to securely sign in to your application using their existing credentials, providing access to basic profile information while maintaining user privacy and control.
- **[Using the REST API from JS and the Browser](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/rest-api-javascript/)**: Learn how to make REST API calls directly from JavaScript in web browsers. This guide covers both authenticated and unauthenticated requests using the Fetch API, explains CORS configuration requirements, and shows how to whitelist your domains to prevent cross-origin errors when building client-side applications.

Before using the WordPress.com REST API in your applications, please review our guidelines for responsible use:

- **[Guidelines for Responsible Use of Automattic's APIs](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-automattics-apis/)**: Understand the terms of use, best practices, and ethical guidelines for using WordPress.com REST APIs.

If you’re looking for the WordPress REST API that shipped as part of WordPress core in version 4.7, see [its documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). Note that this API is also enabled on WordPress.com, but the URL structure on WordPress.com is slightly different than for self-hosted sites. See [this post](https://developer.wordpress.com/2016/11/11/wordpress-rest-api-on-wordpress-com/) for more details.
