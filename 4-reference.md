# REST API Reference

Welcome to the WordPress.com REST API reference docs page. This doc page lists a selection of available endpoints, with each linking to a full page detailing the input, output, and example code in curl and PHP.  

Alternatively, the [Development Console](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/console/) that provides a complete view of all available endpoints grouped by namespace and version. While it doesn't provide in-depth details for each endpoint, it does allow you to construct and test real API requests to each endpoint interactively.

> If you’re not sure how to make calls to the API, you might want to check out the [Getting Started](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/getting-started/) guide.

For more information about a particular endpoint, click on its name under the Resource header. You’ll be taken to the endpoint’s documentation page, which includes what query parameters the endpoint will accept, what the JSON object’s parameters will be in the response, and an example query/response.
