## REST API Reference

Welcome to the WordPress.com REST API reference docs page. Below, you’ll find a full listing of all the available endpoints. As we add more endpoints, they will be automatically documented here and available through the [Developer Console](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/console/).

There are two main ways to explore the API: the reference documentation and the development console.  
- The reference docs page (developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/) lists a selection of available endpoints, with each linking to a full page detailing the input, output, and example code in curl and PHP.  
- The development console (developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/console/) provides a complete view of all available endpoints grouped by namespace and version. While it doesn't provide in-depth details for each endpoint, it does allow you to construct and test real API requests to each endpoint interactively.

If you’re not sure how to make calls to the API, you might want to check out the [Getting Started](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/getting-started/) guide or the walkthrough on [authentication](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/).

For more information about a particular endpoint, click on its name under the Resource header. You’ll be taken to the endpoint’s documentation page, which includes what query parameters the endpoint will accept, what the JSON object’s parameters will be in the response, and an example query/response.

If you’re looking for the WordPress REST API that shipped as part of WordPress core in version 4.7, see [its documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). Note that this API is also enabled on WordPress.com, but the URL structure on WordPress.com is slightly different than for self-hosted sites. See [this post](https://developer.wordpress.com/2016/11/11/wordpress-rest-api-on-wordpress-com/) for more details.
