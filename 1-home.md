You can find a list of available endpoints in the [REST API Reference](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/reference). To explore and test them interactively, head over to the [Developer Console](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/console/).

If you’re looking for the WordPress REST API that shipped as part of WordPress core in version 4.7, see [its documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). Note that this API is also enabled on WordPress.com, but the URL structure on WordPress.com is slightly different than for self-hosted sites. See [this post](https://developer.wordpress.com/2016/11/11/wordpress-rest-api-on-wordpress-com/) for more details.
